# AirBnB Clone - The Console (Novice)

## Project Overview
This project is the first step in building an **AirBnB clone**. It focuses on creating a **command-line interpreter** in Python to manage objects such as `BaseModel`. 

The interpreter allows you to:
- Create new objects
- Retrieve objects by ID
- Update object attributes
- Delete objects
- Save objects to a JSON file and reload them

This demonstrates:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Serialization & Deserialization using JSON
- Unit Testing with Python
- Command interpreter using `cmd` module
